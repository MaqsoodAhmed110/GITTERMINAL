# C++ Program: Addition of Two Integers

This C++ program calculates the sum of two integers entered by the user.

## Program Description

The program prompts the user to enter two integers. It then calculates the sum of these two integers and prints the result.

## Code Explanation

### Includes
The `#include <iostream>` directive is used to include the Input/Output stream library in the program. This library provides functions like `cout` and `cin` for standard input/output operations.

### Namespace
The `using namespace std;` statement allows us to use symbols from the `std` namespace without prefixing them with `std::`.

### Main Function
The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It declares three integer variables: `first_number`, `second_number`, and `sum`.

### Input
The program prompts the user to enter two integers using the `cout` and `cin` statements. The values entered by the user are stored in the variables `first_number` and `second_number`.

### Calculation
The sum of the two integers is calculated and stored in the variable `sum` using the addition operator `+`.

### Output
The program then prints the sum of the two numbers using the `cout` statement.

## Running the Program

To run the program:
1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

    ```bash
    g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
    ```

    Replace `program_name.cpp` with the name of your C++ source code file.

2. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter two integers and view the sum.
